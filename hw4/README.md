# HW#4

This homework studied different techniques of regression using feature augmentation. It aimed to compare the results of Ridge regularization and its kernelized version. You can find its details in `regression.py`.

Another topic covered was PCA. We used `sklearn` dataset and tried to do "face reconstruction" with a limited number of eigenvectors from the dataset.
